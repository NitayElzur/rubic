                puzzle toy- the Rubik’s Cube- was created to help students understand three-dimensional problems. The
                prototype Magic Cube did things that the world had not seen before. It turned, it twisted and yet it did
                not break. Adding 54 colorful stickers to the six sides gave the puzzle its iconic look. Over 40 years
                of history has led the Rubik’s Cube to become one of the best-selling toys ever. With the new Rubik’s
                Apprentice- you can go from an absolute beginner to the puzzle Cube master of your house. Show your
                peers that you can accomplish something new with this adult toy! This smart game makes the perfect gift
