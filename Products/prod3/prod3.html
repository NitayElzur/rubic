                toy- the Rubik’s Cube- was created to help students understand three-dimensional problems. The prototype
                Magic Cube did things that the world had not seen before. It turned, it twisted and yet it did not
                break. Adding 54 colorful stickers to the six sides gave the puzzle its iconic look. Over 40 years of
                history has led the Rubik’s Cube to become one of the best-selling toys ever. With the new Rubik’s
                Phantom- you can become the puzzle Cube master of your house with thermochromic technology. Show your
                peers that you can accomplish something new with this toy! This smart Cube makes the perfect gift idea
